Describing command line:

-As a beginner in the web developing world, I am using Git for Windows as my command line.
A command line is program that operates from a shell and it allows you to create new
folders and/or directorys in your computers file by typing in specific commands for each task

I did not stick to the timebox guidelines. I did a lot more time because basically I was
having fun learning new commands

5 commands I used:
ls
- it lists all folders within the files that is currently working on

cd
- change to new directory

mkdir
- make new directory if needed

cd ..
- to go to previous directory

touch
- create a new file
